# Student Adaptability Prediction in Online Education Environments

This repository contains code for predicting student adaptability levels in online education environments using various machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to predict students' adaptability levels in online education environments based on their behavior and characteristics. We explore the application of different machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance.

## Libraries Used
- **scikit-learn**: Used for machine learning tasks including model selection, preprocessing, and evaluation.
- **ydata_profiling**: Utilized for generating data profile reports to gain insights into the dataset.
- **pandas** and **numpy**: Employed for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: Used for creating static plots to visualize data and evaluation metrics.
- **plotly**: Utilized for creating interactive plots to explore data and model performance.
- **warnings**: Used to ignore any unnecessary warnings during code execution.

## Contents
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The notebook file (`students_adaptability_prediction.ipynb`) contains code implementation for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and analysis.
- **Dataset**: The dataset file (`Dataset_students_adaptability_level_online_education.csv`) contains features related to students' behaviors and characteristics, along with their corresponding adaptability levels.
